This course involved designing an embedded system for a game which is based on a keep-up challenge. Node 1 consists of ATMEGA162, node 2 i an Arduino 2560, and node 3 is a Micro:bit (not functional). Features of this project inclded:
            
            - An OLED display for menu 
            - Saving of highscore
            - Variation of controller types
            - PID postional controller with joystick/slider as input
            - Fully functional "Paint"
            - Screensaver
            - Songs
            - Brightness configurations
      
             
The working principle of the system was based on a solenoid to push the ball, motor to to drive along the x-axis and a servo motor for controlling the angle of the solenoid. IR sensor and sources was placed along the box to provide a function for checking if the game was over.
