This course involved designing an embedded system for a game originally meant to be pong, but later altered to be a keep-up challenge. features of this project inclded:

An OLED display for menus and pages
EEPROM Highscore List
Variation of controller type
PID postional controller with slider as input
Velocity feedforward with joystick as input
The working principle of the system was based on a solenoid to push the ball, motor to to drive along the x-axis and a servo motor for controlling the angle of the solenoid. Two IR sensors and sources was placed along the box to provide a function for counting points and to check if the game was over.
